It's easy to write a crappy blog post, a confusing manual, or a useless comment.  When I re-read things I wrote in the past, I'm amazed that some people read them.  Often, my writing was actively harmful to the readers; I was pushing them away rather than drawing them in.  I imagine that the most common reaction to my articles has been for people to click the *Close Tab* button.

In the last year, I've tried to follow a few writing guidelines to make my writing more reader-friendly.  Let me tell you about them.

**Use words that a 5th grader would understand.**  My first guideline is to avoid complex and uncommon words when simple and common ones will do.  I don't want my readers to lookup words in the middle of their reading.  A rich vocabulary is a great thing to have, but it's not useful when describing the command-line arguments of a program.

**Use sentence structure that a 5th grader could follow.**  My second guideline is to avoid constructing sentences that hard difficult to parse.


**Stop trying to sound so fucking smart â€” just express yourself like a normal person.**  My last guideline is to avoid using style to make myself sound smart, and concentrate on the substance.
