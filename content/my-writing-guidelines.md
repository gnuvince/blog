It's easy to write a crappy blog post, a confusing manual, or a useless comment.  When I re-read some of the things I wrote in the past, I'm amazed that people read them.  My writing was often actively harmful to the readers; I was pushing them away rather than drawing them in.  The most common reaction to my articles must have been for people to click the *Close Tab* button.

In the last year, I've tried to follow a few writing guidelines to make my writing more reader-friendly.  They are inspired from books by authors like Strunk and White or Zinsser.  Let me tell you about them.

**Use words that a 5th grader would understand.**  I try to avoid complex and uncommon words when simple and common ones will do.  I don't want my readers to reach for their thesaurus while they are reading.  A rich vocabulary is a great thing to have, it's a sign of a person who is well-read; but a rich vocabulary is not useful when I'm describing the command-line arguments of my programs.

**Use sentence structure that a 5th grader could follow.**  In grad school, I wrote and read plenty of articles that used the passive voice.

**Keep it short, stupid.**  I'm prone to writing more than is necessary, to include details that people who will read my work already know.  Keeping things shorter makes it more likely that I'll be read, and the main topic will not be diluted.

**Don't pad substance with style.**  If I have little to say, then there should not be many words to say it.  It's okay to "only" use 100 words to say something.
