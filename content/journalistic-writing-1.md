I recently purchased [Journalistic Writing](https://www.amazon.ca/Journalistic-Writing-Building-Skills-Honing-ebook/dp/B003XU66X4/) by Robert Knight.  I'm not a journalist, but I'm sure some of his lessons transfer to other areas of non-fiction writing.  At the end of the first chapter, the author presents the reader with a number of sentences that contain unneeded *thats*, *there is's*, *there are's*, etc.; the goal of the exercise is to rewrite the sentences without them.  Here is my attempt.

> There were half a dozen vintage airplanes standing in the foreground of the museum.
