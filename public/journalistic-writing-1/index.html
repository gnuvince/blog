        <p>I recently purchased <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Journalistic-Writing-Building-Skills-Honing-ebook/dp/B003XU66X4/">Journalistic Writing</a> by Robert Knight.  I&rsquo;m not a journalist, but I&rsquo;m sure some of his lessons transfer to other areas of non-fiction writing.  At the end of the first chapter, the author presents the reader with a number of sentences that contain unneeded <em>thats</em>, <em>there is&rsquo;s</em>, <em>there are&rsquo;s</em>, etc.; the goal of the exercise is to rewrite the sentences without them.  Here is my attempt.</p>
