        <p>Many programming books give advice on how we can make our code clean. It seems to be quite a lucrative industry, because these keeping coming out year after year and programmers keep buying them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these books mostly concern themselves with what the <em>text</em> of the code ought to look like, and not with what the <em>code itself</em> ought to be.
They give advice such as &ldquo;use meaningful names&rdquo;, &ldquo;keep methods short&rdquo;, &ldquo;prefer dynamic dispatch to <code>switch</code>&rdquo;, &ldquo;depend upon abstractions, not concretions&rdquo;, etc., but programs that abide by that advice are not magically readable or clean.
(In fact, it seems that the more of this advice that we apply to a program, the more we create a &ldquo;clean mess&rdquo;.)
But if we got the core of the program wrong&mdash;solving the wrong problem, using the wrong tool, having piles of unnecessary abstractions&mdash;no amount of advice about using private fields instead of public ones is going to meaningfully improve our program.</p>
<p>These books should be understood as our industry&rsquo;s <em>Strunk and White</em> or <em>The Chicago Manual of Style</em>: the advice they give on what <em>text</em> ought to look like can be useful, but if an article is uninteresting, readers won&rsquo;t care our about our usage of oxford commas.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s make sure when we review our peers&rsquo; code that we don&rsquo;t miss the forest for the trees and give them endless suggestions about how they could make their code &ldquo;cleaner&rdquo; by changing superficial details and instead focus on whether their general approach to the problem is sound or whether new requirements justify a different overall architecture.</p>
