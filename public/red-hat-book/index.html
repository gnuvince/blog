        <p>Can you point to a book that changed your outlook on life and had a profound impact on the kind of person you are? For me, that book would be <em>Learning Red Hat Linux</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/red-hat.jpg" alt="Learning Red Hat Linux Cover"></p>
<p>In 1997, I was 14 and I decided that I wanted to be hacker.  In order to look the part, I wanted to install Linux on my computer.  This was early in Linux&rsquo;s life and the distributions of the time didn&rsquo;t have easy-to-use installers&mdash;we had to create root and boot floppies with a tool called rawrite.exe.  And since I couldn&rsquo;t read English very well back then and knew little about computers, I understood almost nothing that the Slackware 3.4 installation program asked.  I failed to install Linux.  Not a great start for a would-be hacker.</p>
<p>Fast-forward a couple of years, my English had improved and the installation program of Mandrake 6.1 was easy&mdash;no questions about the size of inodes&mdash;and I managed to get my first Linux desktop up and running!  But now what?  The CD sleeve gave instructions for the installation, but not for going online or manipulating files.</p>
<p>Somehow, I got my hands on a copy of O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s <em>Learning Red Hat Linux</em> and the most amazing thing happened to me: as I read, I learned!  During a visit at my grand-parents&rsquo;, I read the chapter that explained how to use <code>ls</code>, <code>cp</code>, <code>mv</code>, and others to manipulate files and directories.  When I got home, I ran to my PC and I was able to use the terminal and the commands I had learned to do meaningful work!  After that, I was hooked: I learned about dozens of classic Unix commands, about the directory layout of Linux, and how to install new software with <code>rpm</code>.  I even routinely reconfigured and recompiled my own kernel.  At 16 years old, <em>Learning Red Hat Linux</em> made me realize that reading was the path to understanding, that I could learn any subject by myself if I just took the time to read about it.</p>
<p>I am 33 years old now, and I still read a lot.  Whenever I want to learn something new, I head over to Amazon.  I learned to play chess, poker, and backgammon from books; the original <em>Programming Ruby</em> AKA Pickaxe by Thomas and Hunt got me started in programming; these days I read books that give me tips to improve my writing (hopefully they make these articles less painful for you to read); when I got my first girlfriend, I even read <em>A Complete Idiot&rsquo;s Guide to Amazing Sex</em>!</p>
<p><em>Learning Red Hat Linux</em> is not a classic like <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> or <em>How to Make Friends and Influence People</em>, but its impact on my life has been immediate and lasting and I will be forever grateful for it.</p>
