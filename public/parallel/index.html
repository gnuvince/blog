MAIN POINTS:
    - GNU Parallel can be really helpful to make some CLI tasks finish faster
    - GNU Parallel has a confusing interface
    - Two use cases: (1) run one command on multiple inputs, (2) run multiple commands
-->
<p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">GNU Parallel</a><sup>1</sup> is
a great tool if you want to reduce the running time of a command-line
job.  Last week, I had a job that took 30+ minutes to run
sequentially, but finished in less than two minutes when I ran it with
Parallel on a 40-core machine.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, GNU Parallel does not have a very intuitive interface
and that&rsquo;s a significant hurdle for people who want to use it.  I&rsquo;ve
been frustrated in the past, and I&rsquo;m sure many of you reading have
too.  In this post, I&rsquo;ll show you how to use GNU Parallel to do two
basic, but very useful tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run <em>one</em> command on <em>multiple inputs</em> in parallel;</li>
<li>Run <em>multiple commands</em> in parallel.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>To help us in our examples, I have created a directory that contains
the files we&rsquo;ll work with.  Their names and their contents is listed
below.  You can download this directory <a href="https://vfoley.xyz/parallel-demo.zip">as a zip
file</a>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>a.txt:
Avocado

b.txt:
Broccoli

c.txt:
Cauliflower

cmdlist:
du -h a.txt
sha1sum b.txt
tr a-z A-Z &lt;c.txt

filelist:
a.txt
b.txt
c.txt
</code></pre><h2 id="running-one-command-on-multiple-inputs">Running <em>one</em> command on <em>multiple inputs</em></h2>
<p>There are two ways to pass inputs to a command in GNU Parallel: via
the command-line arguments or via a file (or stdin).</p>
<p>You tell GNU parallel to take its inputs from the command line with
the <code>:::</code> operator.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ parallel &#39;sha1sum {}&#39; ::: *.txt
d8bcd7a949a2fb7a3e1740e4c61e52f46b781aea  a.txt
3db0058f7068968d90679ceb2184441c729782b9  b.txt
a9db4a2565b96696b594965ef52a98ebadfcc2b8  c.txt

$ parallel &#39;sha1sum {}&#39; ::: a.txt cmdlist
d8bcd7a949a2fb7a3e1740e4c61e52f46b781aea  a.txt
814ca442838f9aa6ec2c01f5ed90de4620cfa990  cmdlist
</code></pre><p>In this example, the command we want to run is sha1sum and the <code>{}</code>
is a <em>placeholder</em> that is be replaced by an input when invoking the
command.</p>
<p><i>(Note: Readers already familiar with GNU Parallel will see that I am
being overly explicit in these examples.  In the example above, I
didn&rsquo;t need to quote the command; in this particular case, I didn&rsquo;t
even need to use a placeholder.  But to be as clear as possible, I
will avoid the shortcuts in this post.)</i></p>
<p>You tell GNU Parallel to take its inputs from a file with the <code>::::</code>
operator.  If the filename is <code>-</code>, GNU Parallel reads from stdin.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ parallel &#39;sha1sum {}&#39; :::: filelist
d8bcd7a949a2fb7a3e1740e4c61e52f46b781aea  a.txt
3db0058f7068968d90679ceb2184441c729782b9  b.txt
a9db4a2565b96696b594965ef52a98ebadfcc2b8  c.txt

$ grep [ac] filelist | parallel &#39;tr a-z A-Z &lt;{}&#39; :::: -
AVOCADO
CAULIFLOWER
</code></pre><p>I think you&rsquo;ll find this to be the most useful form of GNU Parallel.
You can build a Unix pipeline using familiar tools&mdash;sed, awk,
grep&mdash;to construct a list of inputs and then pipe them to parallel.</p>
<h2 id="running-multiple-commands-in-parallel">Running <em>multiple commands</em> in parallel</h2>
<p>To run multiple commands in parallel, use the placeholder as the
command name.  Like in the previous section, you obtain the command
name from the command-line arguments with the <code>:::</code> operator and from
a file or stdin with the <code>::::</code> operator.</p>

</code></pre><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This was a super simple introduction to GNU Parallel; there are a lot
of features that we didn&rsquo;t cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>composing and permuting the inputs from multiple files</li>
<li>controlling the number of concurrent jobs</li>
<li>spreading jobs across multiple machines</li>
<li>using advanced placeholder functionality</li>
</ul>
<p>But now that you have a more firm grasp of the basic concepts, you can
work your way up to this advanced functionality.</p>
