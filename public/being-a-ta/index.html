        <p>Being a teaching assistant is a job that most graduate students are asked&mdash;pressured even&mdash;to do.
During my time at McGill, I was a T.A. three times: twice for the introduction to compiler design class (taught by my adviser), and once for a functional programming class.
It was difficult, time-consuming, and not well paid, yet being a T.A. was the best job I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had many bad T.A.&rsquo;s when I was an undergrad; absent from the message boards, with a poor understanding of the subject, and confusing in their explanations, they make hard classes more difficult and bad classes unbearable.
I was determined to be better and so I spent <em>way</em> more time on my duties than the 5 hours per week that the university paid me.
I reviewed the material carefully, I practiced explaining tricky topics, and I attended lectures.</p>
<p>For the compiler class, my advisor allowed me to design a new term project.
I selected a subset of the Go programming language (which we call Golite), I implemented a reference compiler, I wrote detailed specifications of the syntax and type system, and I prepared slides for class.
This made me very familiar and sympathetic of the difficulties that students encountered.
My fellow lab mates commented that I took the job too seriously, but I believe the results were worth the effort.
Before, the compiler class had 15-16 students per semester; with the new Golite project, enrollment rose to 50!
On a personal level, all the preparation work made me a better programmer, writer, and pedagogue.
The real prize, though, came from my interactions with the students.
Everyone in the class worked really hard on their project, and I was very pleased with the results.
Astute students reported bugs in my reference implementation or inaccuracies in the specification;
I learned Haskell tricks and C tools from kids who, at 20, were smarter than I will ever be;
I received a huge hug from a student who broke in tears when she and I finally fixed a difficult bug in her project;
I became friends with some of the students who frequently came to my office hours;
and I found that nurturing students into capable craftsmen was an important responsability and it made me feel good about myself.</p>
<p>At the end of the term, students are asked to evaluate the class.
I was so proud that in spite of the class&rsquo;s difficulty and heavy workload they universally thought that the subjet was interesting and well-taught and that the project was fun, challenging, and practical.</p>
<p>I will leave you with some comments written about me in the students&rsquo; class evaluations.
It&rsquo;s a little &ldquo;braggy&rdquo;, but I was very moved by their kind words&mdash;they made the time, effort, and sweat that I invested worth it.</p>

<p>He is the best teaching assistant I have ever had. If there is an award for being a teaching assistant, give him two of those.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the best TA&rsquo;s of McGill! Always available and willing to help during his office hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Best T.A. I&rsquo;ve ever interacted with at McGill (and I&rsquo;ve been here a while&hellip;)! Extremely helpful, quick to answer questions, very knowledgable, and most importantly cares about the students!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Vincent is the most dedicated TA I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Knowledgeable, competent, ready and actually attends lectures. An excellent TA amongst the cesspool of horribles TAs in Mcgill CS.</p>
