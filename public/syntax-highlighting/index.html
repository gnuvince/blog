        <p>The purpose of syntax highlighting is to draw attention
to certain parts of the code: it helps us to identify when a comment or a
string literal is not properly terminated, when a keyword is misspelled,
or when an escape sequence is invalid.
Lately, I find that editors colorize too many elements and use too
many colors.
(This is a recently-acquired annoyance; maybe age and worse eyesight have something to do with it?)
When every syntactic construct is highlighted, none of them jumps out, and doesn&rsquo;t that
defeat the purpose?</p>
<p>Take a look at the screenshot of <a href="http://sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> below;
I find it difficult to focus on anything, too much is highlighted.</p>

<p>Some programmers have <a href="https://www.robertmelton.com/2016/04/10/syntax-highlighting-off/">written</a>
about turning off syntax highlighting entirely, but this is too extreme for me.
In the <a href="http://www.ctex.org/documents/shredder/src/texbook.pdf">TeXBook (p.13)</a>,
Don Knuth gives this advice to the reader about special typefaces:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Special fonts are effective for emphasis, but not for sustained reading;
your eyes would tire if long portions of this manual were entirely set in
a bold or slanted or italic face.
Therefore roman type accounts for the bulk of most typeset material.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Too many colors&mdash;as is common in programming text editors&mdash;is not ideal,
but neither is a competely barren buffer.
A book that exclusively used Times New Roman 10pt would be extremely difficult to read.
Moderation is key.</p>
<p>I tried many Emacs themes over the years, and we are lucky to
have a large collection of well-designed themes.
If you don&rsquo;t mind a lot of colors, the <a href="https://github.com/cpaulik/emacs-material-theme">material themes</a> are quite nice.</p>
<p>However, since I couldn&rsquo;t find one that used only a few colors,
I decided to build my own, <em>Purp</em>.
It&rsquo;s not too hard to do in Emacs, and there are plenty of
open-source themes that one can use for inspiration and education.
In Purp, I tried to minimize the number of colors
and the number of elements that are highlighted.
You can see the result in the screenshots below.</p>

<p>I consider that the following elements are important enough to have their own color:</p>
<ul>
<li>String and character literals: I want to know if they are properly terminated;</li>
<li>Comments: I want to find them quickly, and in languages that don&rsquo;t have
nested comments, syntax highlighting will show when you made an error;</li>
<li>Function names: a theme called <a href="https://draculatheme.com/emacs/">Dracula</a> gives
function names a bright color and I find that it helps me identify where
a function begins better than the indentation does, so I stole the idea;</li>
<li>Pre-processor commands: these are often not subject to the same rules as the base
language and I wanted to see them easily;</li>
<li>Warnings: some language modes (e.g., Rust) use this face to identify dangerous constructs, so
it&rsquo;s not a bad idea to make sure they are visible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything else uses the default typeface.
I think the code looks much &ldquo;calmer&rdquo; than it did in the Sublime screenshot.</p>
<p>Purp isn&rsquo;t publicly available yet, because there&rsquo;s still a lot of work left to do.
My installation of Emacs defines 418 faces (org mode has 75), but I&rsquo;ve only
defined colors for 25 of those.</p>
