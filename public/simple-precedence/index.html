        <p><a href="https://youtu.be/fIPO4G42wYE">A discussion</a> between Jonathan Blow and Casey Muratori on the handling of precedence in Jon&rsquo;s compiler recently popped in my YouTube feed.
The discussion is three hours long and focuses on implementing operator precedence more easily and more simply in Jai using <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2011/03/19/pratt-parsers-expression-parsing-made-easy/">Pratt parsing</a>.
Jon and Casey also talk about the previous implementation of operator precedence in Jai which used tree-rewriting and the classic approach which organizes the different precedence levels into different production rules.</p>
<p>My favorite approach to operator precedence is the one used in APL, J, and K: <a href="https://code.kx.com/q4m3/4_Operators/#41-operator-precedence">get rid of it</a>.
Array languages are known for their symbol-heavy programs, but something rarely mentioned is that in languages with so many esoteric operators, the rules for reading those operators are the simplest and most straight-forward of all:</p>
<ol>
<li>All operators have the same precedence, no exception.</li>
<li>All operators associate to the right, no exception.</li>
</ol>
<p>With these two rules, it&rsquo;s easy to understand a complex expression: we read right-to-left. Take the following snippet of code (written completely randomly):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>5 | 1 &lt;&lt; 3 &amp; 3 | 1 &lt;&lt; 4
</code></pre><p>In a language like Python or C, do you know what this expression evalutes to without running it or referring to the documentation?
In a language with only the two precedence rules above, it&rsquo;s very easy:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>1 &lt;&lt; 4 = 16</code></li>
<li><code>3 | 16 = 19</code></li>
<li><code>3 &amp; 19 = 3</code></li>
<li><code>1 &lt;&lt; 3 = 8</code></li>
<li><code>5 | 8 = 13</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Having only two simple rules makes it easy for readers of programs to understand complex expressions.
The simple rules also make the life of the language implementors easier: instead of deciding whether to use Pratt Parsing or multi-leveled productions, and deciding on whether <code>&lt;&lt;</code> should have a higher or lower precedence than <code>&amp;</code>, the parsing of operators becomes something that doesn&rsquo;t require a three hour discussion.</p>
<p>The one thing that is lost by going for this radically simpler operator precedence is familiarity.
We&rsquo;ve had PEDMAS drilled into our skulls since junior high; remembering PEDMAS is extremely important for those quizzes on Twitter claming that &ldquo;only 1% of the population gets this question right&rdquo;.
But if we are willing to give up familiarity for a little while—I say for a little while, because eventually the no-precedence approach becomes second nature—we can have a language that&rsquo;s simpler to understand and simpler to implement.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this kind of radical simplicity is rarely seen because programmers don&rsquo;t value simplicity very much and don&rsquo;t mind the extra complexity of things like precedence rules—they even <em>like</em> extra, unnecessary complexity.
But that&rsquo;ll be the subject of another post&hellip;</p>
