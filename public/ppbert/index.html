        <p>I had an itch: I was pretty-printing the <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_ext_dist.html">BERT-encoded</a> terms that we use in a production system at work and it was <em>very</em> slow.  The Erlang shell took more than two minutes to dump the largest file.  (It took about 0.1 second to read and parse the file; the rest was spent in <code>io:format</code>.)  I decided to scratch that itch: I wrote <a href="https://github.com/gnuvince/ppbert">ppbert</a>, a command-line utility that reads BERT-encoded values and pretty-prints them.  I&rsquo;ve worked sporadically on ppbert for almost a year now, I use it daily at work, I&rsquo;m happy with it, and I want to write about some of the things I learned during that journey.</p>
<p>I wanted ppbert to be a good Unix tool.  It was essential that it can read from stdin, write to stdout, and thus can be inserted in a Unix pipeline.  (I&rsquo;m astounded&mdash;and annoyed&mdash;when programs <em>can&rsquo;t</em> be used in a pipe.)  The interface of ppbert should be familiar to Unix users: it reads from stdin, from files, or from a mix of both with <code>-</code> acting as the filename for stdin; normal output goes to stdout, diagnostics and errors go to stderr; the format of warnings and errors follows the typical Unix style (<code>ppbert: reason for error</code>); the return code is 0 on success and 1 on failure; ppbert has a manpage.  The main &ldquo;failure&rdquo; of ppbert as a Unix tool is that it consumes a whole input file before it starts pretty-printing it (a bit like <code>sort(1)</code>).</p>
<p>I wrote ppbert in Rust because I like the language and because I wanted to use it.  But if you&rsquo;d like to hear technical reasons why choosing Rust made sense, here are a few.  First, I wanted something that would be faster than Erlang and it would&rsquo;ve been counter-productive to reach for Python or Ruby; Rust compiles to native code, uses LLVM to apply thousands of optimizations, and many benchmarks shows that the performance of Rust programs is <a href="https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/which-programs-are-fastest.html">right up there with C and C++</a>.  Rust&rsquo;s type system and ownership/borrowing systems are also right up my alley: I suck at programming, I make mistakes with strings and memory in C all the time, and the Rust bondage helps me write better software.  Rust has a very good story for third-party libraries: cargo is an absolute joy to use, and the selection of quality libraries on <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a> is growing quickly (more about good libraries later).  I tried to limit the number of dependencies in ppbert&mdash;for example, I don&rsquo;t use serde to pretty-print JSON&mdash;, but I like that complex functionality is a single line in Cargo.toml away.  Finally, the Rust compiler produces statically-linked executable, which makes it easier to use ppbert on remote servers that don&rsquo;t have development tools installed: I just transfer the executable with <code>scp</code>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy that I chose Rust: I had a faster pretty-printer the first time that I compiled an executable and with some further tweaks, I was able to improve the speed to a level that I&rsquo;m happy with.  Today, I can pretty-print the large BERT file in 3 seconds rather than 2 minutes.  I got some of the extra performance gains by applying lessons that one can learn from any language: buffering your output&mdash;the <code>File</code> struct in Rust doesn&rsquo;t buffer by default; finding ways to do less work in the common cases&mdash;in ppbert I got a satisfying speed boost by avoiding UTF-8 validation when all the bytes of an atom&rsquo;s name where in the ASCII range.  I also got some speed boosts by reaching for some of Rust&rsquo;s unsafe functions, for example by using the <code>.get_unchecked()</code> Vec method when the bound checks had already been performed.  I found that using <code>perf</code> with Rust is underwhelming; it could tell me in which functions ppbert spent most of its time, but I had to divine the reasons.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite happy with the third-party crates that I use.  I started using nom, a parser combinator library, but I found that using its macros was unnatural and injecting my own errors was awkward, so I stopped using it and wrote my own parser instead.  (This was with nom 2; I have not tried the newer nom 3.)  For command-line arguments parsing, I like clap: it&rsquo;s easy to add new options, and easy to consume them.  Rayon blew me away!  I used it in ppbert&rsquo;s sibling program, bert-convert, and simply by using <code>.par_iter()</code> rather than <code>.iter()</code>, I made the conversion of all our production .bert files to .bert2 twice as fast.  The crates num and encoding, which I use for bigints and latin-1 support respectively, were easy to use and because they do their jobs without problems, I haven&rsquo;t needed to look at that code in a long time.</p>
<p>Some people lament the state of Rust&rsquo;s tooling, particularly IDE support.  I&rsquo;m a simple man: I like <a href="http://vfoley.xyz/syntax-highlighting/">some syntax highlighting</a>, automatic indentation, jump-to-definition, and auto-completion.  Emacs, rust-mode, and racer-mode gave me all that.</p>
<p>One issue I ran into with Rust itself was how the <code>println!()</code> macro behaves in a pipeline: if a pipe is closed early while printing a long string, println panics.  The code below exhibits the behaviour in a simple program.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>/tmp$ cat sample.rs
fn main() {
    let mut buf = String::new();
    for _ in 0 .. 65536 {
        buf.push_str(&#34;foo\n&#34;)
    }
    println!(&#34;{}&#34;, buf);
}

/tmp$ rustc -O sample.rs

/tmp$ ./sample | head -n 1
foo
thread &#39;main&#39; panicked at &#39;failed printing to stdout: Broken pipe (os error 32)&#39;, /checkout/src/libstd/io/stdio.rs:690:8
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.
</code></pre><p>There is an easy fix, and that&rsquo;s to use the <code>writeln!()</code> macro and to ignore errors.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>/tmp$ cat sample.rs
use std::io::{self, Write};

fn main() {
    let mut buf = String::new();
    for _ in 0 .. 65536 {
        buf.push_str(&#34;foo\n&#34;)
    }
    let _ = writeln!(io::stdout(), &#34;{}&#34;, buf);
}

/tmp$ rustc -O sample.rs

/tmp$ ./sample | head -n 1
foo
</code></pre><p>It&rsquo;s something to be wary of if you write Unix utilities in Rust.</p>
<p>Ppbert is not a popular program&mdash;I&rsquo;m probably its only user&mdash;because BERT is not a very popular format.  Still, I&rsquo;m happy with the work I did, I&rsquo;m happy that I scratched that itch, and I&rsquo;m happy that ppbert has been a good vehicle for learning about Rust, improving performance, and creating good Unix programs.</p>
