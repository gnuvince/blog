        <p>A few years ago, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/3oc7jk/nice_emacs_themes_with_a_limited_number_of_colors/">I asked on Reddit</a> whether anyone had recommendations for a theme that used only a few colors.  I found that too many colors&mdash;what many refer to as a Christmas tree&mdash;was not helping me understand code better, but in fact was distracting me.  I also thought that turning off syntax highlighting entirely was too radical a solution.  I wanted a theme that would just highlight a few, well-chosen elements.  Unfortunately, most of the minimal themes that I found were monochrome, which is not what I was looking for.</p>
<p>So I began working on a <a href="https://vfoley.xyz/syntax-highlighting/">theme of few colors</a> that I&rsquo;ve been using and tweaking for a while now.  I&rsquo;ve finally decided to make it available on <a href="https://github.com/gnuvince/purp">Github</a> and publish it to <a href="https://melpa.org/#/purp-theme">MELPA</a>.  You can install purp by invoking the command <code>M-x package-install RET purp-theme</code>.  A light version called <code>purp-light</code> is also included in the package.</p>
<p>I have not gone and modified the color of every face in every mode, just the ones that I encountered daily in my work.  In programming modes, you&rsquo;ll see the following colors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purple for function definitions</li>
<li>Green for comments</li>
<li>Orange for string literals</li>
<li>Yellow on red for dangerous stuff (e.g., the <code>unsafe</code> keyword in Rust)</li>
<li>White (or black) for everything else</li>
</ul>
<p>The colors for function definitions and comments makes them easy to find and the color for strings helps to spot an un-escaped double quote.</p>
<p>I hope you like purp, there&rsquo;s a lot of work left to be done, including how to not have it activate as soon as it&rsquo;s installed, which is a really bad first impression.</p>
