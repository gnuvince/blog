MAIN POINTS:

    - simple problem (individual elements to ranges)
    - some corner cases
    - how to test so that I'm confident that the functions is correct?
-->
<p>For one of my projects at work, I thought I could reduce memory usage
by storing vectors of sorted integers as vectors of ranges.  For
example, the vector <code>[1,3,4,5,10,14,15,16,17,18]</code> would be represented
by <code>[1, 3..5, 10, 14..18]</code>.</p>
<p>(Spoiler: the memory usage was higher because there weren&rsquo;t enough
runs of consecutive numbers to offset the cost of using 8 bytes rather
than 4 bytes for single numbers.)</p>
<p>I quickly wrote a Rust function to convert a slice of u32s to a vector of ranges.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>type Range = (u32, u32);

/// Returns the shortest vector of ranges that covers `xs`.
///
/// The argument `xs` should (1) be sorted, (2) contain no dupes.
/// If `xs` respects (1) and (2), then the following invariant holds:
///     expand(&amp;to_ranges(&amp;xs)) == xs
pub fn to_ranges(xs: &amp;[u32]) -&gt; Vec&lt;Range&gt; {
    let mut v: Vec&lt;Range&gt; = Vec::new();

    if xs.is_empty() {
        return v;
    }

    let mut start_idx = 0;
    for idx in 1 .. xs.len() {
        if xs[idx] != xs[idx-1] + 1 {
            v.push( (xs[start_idx], xs[idx-1]) );
            start_idx = idx;
        }
    }
    v.push( (xs[start_idx], xs[xs.len() - 1]) );
    v.shrink_to_fit();
    return v;
}
</code></pre><p>Array indices can be hard to get right, and anything more complex than
a simple <em>for</em> loop and I start doubting myself and I wonder if
there&rsquo;s a subtlety I&rsquo;ve gotten wrong.  My code seems to work, but I&rsquo;m
afraid that it could blow up at the worst possible time.  I&rsquo;m sure
it&rsquo;s a feeling shared by many programmers.</p>
<p>To give us more confidence, we write unit tests.  We prepare carefully
crafted inputs and we write down their expected outputs; we pass the
inputs to our function, and we ensure that our predicted outputs match
the actual outputs.  Here&rsquo;s a unit test for <code>to_ranges</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#[test]
fn manual_tests() {
    assert!(to_ranges(&amp;[]).is_empty());
    assert_eq!(vec![(1,1), (3,3), (5,5)], to_ranges(&amp;[1,3,5]));
    assert_eq!(vec![(1,4)], to_ranges(&amp;[1,2,3,4]));
    assert_eq!(
        vec![(1,1), (3,5), (10,10), (14,18)],
        to_ranges(&amp;[1,3,4,5,10,14,15,16,17,18]));
}
</code></pre><p>Is this sufficient?  I don&rsquo;t know.  All the tests pass, but there are
only 4, that&rsquo;s not very much.  Maybe there&rsquo;s a condition that&rsquo;s not
tested here?  Maybe I subconsciously avoided an edge case?  We wanted
to increase our confidence in our code, but we&rsquo;ve only increased our
self-doubt!</p>
<p>Property testing is just another tool in the testing toolbox, but it&rsquo;s
one that can increase our confidence in our code.  Rather than test a
function in a case-by-case fashion, we instead write properties: we
express relationships that exist between <strong>all</strong> inputs and their
outputs.  We then let a generator feed hundreds, even thousands of
test cases to our function and verify that our properties hold.</p>
<p>The property for <code>to_ranges</code> is given in its doc-comment: if an acceptable
input—a slice of sorted u32s with no duplicates—is given, then we should
be able to &ldquo;expand&rdquo; the output and obtain the input again.  This is a common
pattern in property testing.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/proptest">proptest</a> crate, I
create a simple property and I ask the proptest runner to generate
5000 inputs and ensure that the property hold.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>use proptest::prelude::*;
use proptest::test_runner::Config;

pub fn expand(ranges: &amp;[Range]) -&gt; Vec&lt;u32&gt; {
    let mut v: Vec&lt;u32&gt; = Vec::new();
    for (start, end) in ranges {
        v.extend(*start ..= *end);
    }
    return v;
}

proptest! {
    #![proptest_config(Config::with_cases(5000))]
    #[test]
    fn prop_to_ranges(bset in prop::collection::btree_set(any::&lt;u32&gt;(), 0 .. 1000)) {
        let input: Vec&lt;u32&gt; = bset.into_iter().collect();
        let output: Vec&lt;u32&gt; = expand(&amp;to_ranges(&amp;input));
        prop_assert_eq!(&amp;input[..], &amp;output[..]);
    }
}
</code></pre><p>(I use the generator for <code>BTreeSet&lt;u32&gt;</code> to obtain a sorted set of
u32s and then convert to a <code>Vec&lt;u32&gt;</code>.  I think it&rsquo;s simpler than
generating a vector, sorting it, and de-duplicating it.)</p>
<p>With not very many lines of code, I&rsquo;m able to greatly increase my confidence
that I didn&rsquo;t mess up the indexes in <code>to_ranges</code>.  It&rsquo;s still possible that
there&rsquo;s something wrong that my property test missed, but it would be much
less likely that a bug was present in code that was tested 5000 times than
in code that was tested 4 times.</p>
<p>Property tests are a great addition to your testing toolbox.  A recent
book by Fred Hébert, <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/fhproper/property-based-testing-with-proper-erlang-and-elixir">Property-Based Testing with PropEr, Erlang, and
Elixir</a>,
offers a great and approachable introduction to property testing using
tools for Erlang and Elixir.  Although the book is mostly targeted at
programmers of these two communities, there is enough
language-agnostic advice to make it a good purchase for anyone
interested in using property testing to make their programs more
robust.</p>
